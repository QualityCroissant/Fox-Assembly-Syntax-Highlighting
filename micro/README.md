This is a plugin for Micro which adds support for Fox Assembly source-code syntax highlighting.

You can install it by moving the foxasm directory into the "plug" directory, at the location of Micro's configuration files.

For example, this could be in ~/.config/micro/plug, so the contents of foxasm would go in ~/.config/micro/plug/foxasm
